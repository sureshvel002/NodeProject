5. What Happens in Each File
app.js: Initializes Express, sets view engine, serves static files, and uses routes.

routes/index.js: Handles routing logic for showing the quiz and processing results.

views/: Contains EJS templates to render pages.

public/: Holds static assets like CSS and images.

6. Notes
This app uses EJS for templating. Make sure you are familiar with EJS syntax.

All quiz questions and logic are handled server-side using Express.

You can modify the quiz questions inside the routes/index.js file.
